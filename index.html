       What are Web Applications?
    </h2>

    <p>
        Web applications are software programs that run on a web server and can be accessed through a web browser. They are designed to provide interactive services to users over the internet or an intranet. These applications range from simple websites to complex, data-driven platforms like online banking systems, e-commerce sites, and social media networks.

        How Web Applications Work
        Client-Server Architecture:
        
        Client Side: This is the front end of the web application, typically written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users interact with the web application through the browser.
        Server Side: This is the back end where the business logic, data processing, and database interactions happen. It is developed using server-side languages like Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, or Node.js.
        HTTP Requests and Responses:
        
        When a user performs an action on the web application, such as filling out a form or clicking a button, the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.
        The server processes this request, potentially interacting with a back-end database to retrieve or store data, and then sends back an HTTP response that the browser uses to update the web page.
        Interaction with Back-End Databases
        A key part of many web applications is their ability to interact with back-end databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. Hereâ€™s how this typically works:

       Interaction with Databases
    </h2>
     <!-- This tag is for paragraph information. -->
        <p>
            Database Management Systems (DBMS): Web applications commonly use relational databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL databases (like MongoDB, Cassandra) as their data storage systems.

            Data Access Layer:

            SQL for Relational Databases: In relational databases, Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to perform database operations. Queries can be issued to create, read, update, or delete (CRUD) data.
            NoSQL Databases: These use different query languages and structures, often more flexible and suitable for large-scale, unstructured, or semi-structured data.
            Server-Side Scripting:

            When the server receives an HTTP request that requires data interaction, server-side scripts handle the process. For example, in a PHP application, a PHP script might be executed to query the database.
            These scripts connect to the database, execute the required operations, and then process the results.
            Database Connections:

            Connection Pools: To manage resources efficiently, web servers often use connection pools to maintain a pool of database connections that can be reused, rather than opening and closing connections for every single request.
            ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Many web applications use ORMs like Hibernate (Java), Django ORM (Python), or Sequelize (Node.js) to interact with databases in an object-oriented manner, simplifying complex queries and transactions.
